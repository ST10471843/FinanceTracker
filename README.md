2. Project Overview
-------------------



The  finance tracker is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [Course Name] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., provide a task management system, display weather forecasts, etc.].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```

It helps a user track their finances and how its been managed based on the expene percentage

4. Design Considerations
------------------------



Why:
----
Neutral colors were used for a professional feel.

---

Why:
----
- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

6. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------



During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: The code has no syntax errors yet the app doesn run

2. **Challenge 2**: figuring out the logic behind the code,
I broke it down into a flow chart 


From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

7. Future Enhancements
----------------------


1. **Feature 1**: Allowing users to input information in only one pair of edit text to improve user experience and the screen layout

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.

Error Handling Logic 


Error handling was implemented using Toast. An error messages will be displayed if there is no value inputted in any one of the edit texts. 
the logiv behind the percentages was for the code to check if the percentage is greater than or less than a certain value based on the formula given. once the statement is checked and found true, a relevant message about the users finance management would be displayed.
